# Columbia Engineering Design Challenge: DIY Ventilators for COVID-19

Working with a diverse team of 6 students from 5 different universities, 
we were tasked with designing a DIY solution to the global ventilator shortage problem.

**Figure 1:** Our ventilator design, the *Arbor Vent*, inspired by the mechanics of an Arbor Press, 
is a rack-and-pinion-based squeezing tool which emulates the dynamics of a human hand squeezing a Bag Valve Mask (BVM).
It has a single point of contact on top (like a thumb) and a flat surface on bottom (like a palm).
